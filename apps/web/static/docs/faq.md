# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is AI Summarizer?

AI Summarizer is a modern web application that uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet from Anthropic to generate intelligent, contextual summaries of text. It's built with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS for a fast, responsive user experience.

### Is it free to use?

The application itself is open-source and free. However, you need an Anthropic API account to use real AI summaries. Anthropic charges based on token usage (typically $0.003 per summary). Demo mode is available for free testing without API costs.

### How accurate are the summaries?

Summaries are generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, one of the most advanced AI models available. Accuracy depends on:
- Quality and clarity of input text
- Appropriate summary length selection
- Text complexity and structure

Generally, Claude produces highly accurate and contextual summaries.

### Can I use this offline?

No, the application requires internet connectivity to access the Claude API. However, your summary history is stored locally and can be viewed offline.

## Technical Questions

### What happens to my data?

- **Input text and summaries**: Sent to Anthropic's API for processing, then stored locally in your browser's localStorage
- **No server-side storage**: We don't store your text or summaries on our servers
- **Privacy**: Review [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy) for their data handling

### Is my data secure?

Yes:
- API key stored in server-side environment variables only
- Text sent over HTTPS to Anthropic's secure API
- Local data stored in browser's localStorage (device-level security)
- No third-party tracking or analytics

### What browsers are supported?

Modern browsers with ES6+ support:
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Opera 76+

### Can I run this on mobile?

Yes! The application is fully responsive and works on:
- iOS (Safari, Chrome)
- Android (Chrome, Firefox, Samsung Internet)
- Tablets (iPad, Android tablets)

### Does it work offline?

Partial functionality:
- ‚úÖ View saved summaries and history (stored locally)
- ‚úÖ Browse documentation
- ‚úÖ Navigate the interface
- ‚ùå Generate new summaries (requires API connection)

## Features & Functionality

### What's the maximum text length?

The application accepts up to 100,000 characters of input text. For optimal results:
- Short text (< 500 words): May produce generic summaries
- Medium text (500-2000 words): Best results
- Long text (> 2000 words): May require longer summary lengths

### How do I choose the right summary length?

Guidelines:
- **1-10 words**: Ultra-brief, main topic only
- **10-25 words**: Key points and main idea
- **25-50 words**: Balanced overview with important details
- **50-75 words**: Comprehensive summary with context
- **75-100 words**: Detailed summary with nuances

### Can I export my summaries?

Yes! Multiple export options:
- **History page**: Export all summaries as JSON
- **Saved page**: Export saved summaries as plain text
- **Individual summaries**: Copy to clipboard

### How long is history kept?

History is stored in your browser's localStorage indefinitely until:
- You manually clear it
- You clear browser data
- localStorage quota is exceeded (rare)

### Can I sync across devices?

Currently, no. Summaries are stored locally per browser/device. This is planned for a future update.

## API & Pricing

### How much does it cost to use?

Claude 3.5 Sonnet pricing:
- **Input**: $3.00 per million tokens
- **Output**: $15.00 per million tokens

**Typical costs:**
- Short summary (500 words ‚Üí 50 words): ~$0.003
- Medium summary (1000 words ‚Üí 75 words): ~$0.005
- Long summary (2000 words ‚Üí 100 words): ~$0.010

### What are API tokens?

Tokens are units of text used for API billing:
- ~4 characters = 1 token
- ~750 words = 1000 tokens

Your usage is tracked in the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage).

### How do I get API credits?

1. Sign up at [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Navigate to "Plans & Billing"
3. Choose a plan or add credits:
   - **Pay-as-you-go**: Add credits as needed
   - **Monthly plans**: Set budget limits
4. Use your API key in the application

### What's the difference between tiers?

| Tier | Rate Limit | Cost | Best For |
|------|------------|------|----------|
| Tier 1 (Free) | 50 req/min | Pay-per-use | Testing, light use |
| Tier 2 (Build) | 1000 req/min | Pay-per-use | Development |
| Tier 3 (Scale) | 2000 req/min | Pay-per-use | Production |
| Tier 4 (Enterprise) | Custom | Custom | Large scale |

## Demo Mode

### What is Demo Mode?

Demo Mode generates mock summaries without calling the Claude API. It's useful for:
- Testing the application without costs
- Development and debugging
- When API credits are insufficient

### How do I enable/disable Demo Mode?

In your `.env` file:
```bash
# Enable demo mode
DEMO_MODE=true

# Disable demo mode (use real API)
DEMO_MODE=false
```

Restart the application after changing.

### How can I tell if I'm in Demo Mode?

Demo mode indicators:
- Yellow banner at top of page: "Demo Mode Active"
- Summaries include: `[DEMO MODE]` suffix
- API response includes: `demoMode: true`

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I getting "credit balance too low" error?

Your Anthropic account doesn't have sufficient credits.

**Solution:**
1. Add credits at [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing)
2. Or enable demo mode temporarily

See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting) for details.

### Summaries aren't saving to history

**Common causes:**
- Private/incognito browsing mode
- Browser blocks localStorage
- Browser data/cache cleared

**Solution:**
- Use regular browser mode
- Check browser settings allow localStorage
- Export summaries regularly

See [Troubleshooting - Data & Storage Issues](troubleshooting#data--storage-issues).

### The application is slow

**Expected latency:**
- Claude API: 1-3 seconds
- Demo mode: ~1 second

**If slower:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Anthropic API status
- Test with smaller text
- See [Troubleshooting - Performance Issues](troubleshooting#performance-issues)

## Deployment & Development

### Can I self-host this?

Yes! The application is open-source:
1. Clone the repository
2. Add your `.env` file with API key
3. Build and deploy:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

### How do I deploy to production?
