## Understanding Demo Mode

If you see a "Demo Mode" banner, it means the application is using mock summaries instead of the real Claude API. This happens when:

- No Anthropic API key is configured
- Your Anthropic account has insufficient credits
- The `DEMO_MODE` environment variable is set to `true`

**To enable real AI summaries:**

1. Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Get your API key and add credits
3. Update your `.env` file with your API key
4. Set `DEMO_MODE=false` in your `.env` file
5. Restart the application

## Navigation

- **Dashboard** (`/`): Create new summaries
- **History** (`/history`): View all generated summaries
- **Saved** (`/saved`): Access your bookmarked summaries
- **Settings** (`/settings`): Customize your preferences

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Provide context**: More detailed text usually produces better summaries
2. **Adjust length**: Experiment with different summary lengths for optimal results
3. **Save important summaries**: Use the bookmark feature to keep track of key summaries
4. **Review history**: Learn from past summaries to improve your inputs
